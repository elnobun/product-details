## Technology Used
- VueJS 3
- SCSS
- CSS Grid

I choose `VueJS 3` because of the new composition API that provides a different way 
to manage reactivity at all points in an application, 
without compromising organization and readability.

Taking advantage of modern css features, can help productivity. I used `SCSS` as my
CSS Processor because `SCSS` converts modern css features for older browser
compatibility.
